ABSTRACT

We present new ALMA band-7 data for a sample of six luminous quasars at z (cid:39) 4.8, powered by fast-
growing supermassive black holes (SMBHs) with rather uniform properties: the typical accretion rates and
black hole masses are L/LEdd (cid:39) 0.7 and MBH (cid:39) 109 M(cid:12). Our sample consists of three “FIR-bright” sources
which were individually detected in previous Herschel/SPIRE observations, with star formation rates of SFR >
1000M(cid:12) yr−1, and three “FIR-faint” sources for which Herschel stacking analysis implies a typical SFR of
∼400 M(cid:12) yr−1. The dusty interstellar medium in the hosts of all six quasars is clearly detected in the ALMA
data and resolved on scales of ∼2 kpc, in both continuum (λrest ∼ 150 µm) and [C II] λ 157.74 µm line emission.
The continuum emission is in good agreement with the expectations from the Herschel data, conﬁrming the
intense SF activity in the quasar hosts. Importantly, we detect companion sub-millimeter galaxies (SMGs)
for three sources – one FIR-bright and two FIR-faint, separated by ∼ 14 − 45kpc and < 450kms−1 from
the quasar hosts. The [C II]-based dynamical mass estimates for the interacting SMGs are within a factor of
∼3 of the quasar hosts’ masses, while the continuum emission implies SFRquasar ∼ (2− 11)× SFRSMG. Our
ALMA data therefore clearly support the idea that major mergers are important drivers for rapid early SMBH
growth. However, the fact that not all high-SFR quasar hosts are accompanied by interacting SMGs and the
gas kinematics as observed by ALMA suggest that other processes may be fueling these systems. Our analysis
thus demonstrates the diversity of host galaxy properties and gas accretion mechanisms associated with early
and rapid SMBH growth.

1. INTRODUCTION

Several lines of evidence suggest that the growth histories
of Supermassive Black Holes (SMBHs) are closely linked to
that of their host galaxies. These include the well-known
scaling relations between the SMBH mass (MBH) and sev-
eral properties of the (bulge component of the) hosts, ob-
served in local relic systems (see Kormendy & Ho 2013 for
a recent review). and the coincidence of intense star forma-
tion (SF) and SMBH growth, at higher redshifts. Indeed, for
systems dominated by accretion onto the SMBH – identiﬁed
as active galactic nuclei (AGN) – the luminosities associated
with SMBH accretion (LAGN) and with star formation (LSF)
are correlated over several orders of magnitude (e.g., Netzer
2009; Lutz et al. 2010; Shao et al. 2010; Rosario et al. 2013,
but see also Page et al. 2012). This suggests that the phase of
fast SMBH growth occurs in tandem with intense SF activity,

reaching star formation rates (SFRs) of ∼1000 M(cid:12) yr−1 for
SMBHs with ˙MBH ∼ 15M(cid:12) yr−1 (i.e. LAGN ∼ 1047 ergs−1).
All this supports a general idea that both processes (SF and
AGN) are fed by a common reservoir of cold gas that col-
lapses, forms stars, and (eventually) reaches the central region
of the host galaxy to be accreted by the SMBH.

A particularly popular framework for the co-evolution of
SMBHs and their hosts focuses on major mergers between
massive, gas-rich galaxies. Theoretical studies highlight the
ability of such mergers to account for both the observed prop-
erties of AGN and SF galaxies, and for the SMBH-host rela-
tions in relic systems (see, e.g., Sanders et al. 1988; Di Matteo
et al. 2005; Hopkins et al. 2006 and the review by Alexan-
der & Hickox 2012). In particular, many simulations of such
mergers show a relatively short episode (of order 100 Myr)
of parallel intense SF and AGN activity, with SFRs reach-
ing several hundred M(cid:12) yr−1 (or exceeding ∼ 1000M(cid:12) yr−1
in some simulations; see, e.g., Blecha et al. 2011; DeBuhr
et al. 2011; Sijacki et al. 2011; Capelo et al. 2015; Volon-
teri et al. 2015; Gabor et al. 2015). Observationally, however,
the relevance of mergers to fast SMBH growth, and indeed
to the co-evolutionary framework, is not yet well established.
While some studies of low-z luminous AGN have reported a
high occurrence of mergers (e.g., Bahcall et al. 1997; Veilleux
et al. 2009; Koss et al. 2011), several other studies have
demonstrated that interacting AGN hosts are relatively rare at
1 <∼ z <∼ 2 and their occurrence rate does not exceed what was
found for non-active galaxies (e.g., Gabor et al. 2009; Ben-
nert et al. 2011; Cisternas et al. 2011; Mainieri et al. 2011;
Schawinski et al. 2011, 2012; Kocevski et al. 2012). A possi-
ble explanation for these apparently contradictory results, as

2

Trakhtenbrot et al.

put forward by Treister et al. (2012), is that the merger-driven
scenario may only be relevant for the epochs of fastest growth
of the most massive BH (that is, highest LAGN), and at z > 2
– when the overall rate of major mergers is expected to be
higher (e.g., Genel et al. 2009; Hopkins et al. 2010) and the
amount of gas in the relevant halos is considerably larger (but
see also Dubois et al. 2015).

emission line, which is among the most efﬁcient ISM coolants
(e.g., Stacey et al. 1991, 2010; Carilli & Walter 2013, and ref-
erences therein). These studies have provided additional sup-
port for the coexistence of fast-growing SMBHs and intense
SF activity in their hosts, but mostly could not address the
questions related to the merger-driven scenario, due to lim-
ited sensitivity, resolution, and/or ﬁeld of view. Indeed, no
major mergers were identiﬁed in the aforementioned studies
of high-redshift AGN.
In this study, we focus on a sample of quasar hosts at
z (cid:39) 4.8, for which we have accumulated a wealth of multi-
wavelength data.
In our previous studies, we have shown
that
the SMBHs powering these quasars trace an epoch
of fast, Eddington-limited growth from massive BH seeds,
which is expected to form the most massive BHs known
by z ∼ 4 (Trakhtenbrot et al. 2011, T11 hereafter). Our
Herschel/SPIRE campaign (Mor et al. 2012; Netzer et al.
2014, M12 and N14 hereafter) showed that these fast-growing
SMBHs are hosted by SF galaxies, with ∼ 1/4 of the systems
exceeding SFR ∼ 1000M(cid:12) yr−1, while a stacking analysis of
the other ∼ 3/4 of the systems suggested a typical SFR of
∼400 M(cid:12) yr−1(see also Netzer et al. 2016). The extremely
high SFRs found for the FIR-bright sources were interpreted
as tracing major merger activity, while the lower SFRs found
for most systems were thought to be tracing the early stages
of SF suppression by AGN-driven “feedback”. The poor spa-
tial resolution of the Herschel data (∼ 18(cid:48)(cid:48), or (cid:38) 100kpc)
was, however, insufﬁcient to test these ideas, which can be
now addressed directly with the ALMA FIR continuum and
[C II] λ 157.74 µm emission line observations presented in
this study. In Section 2 we describe the sample, the ALMA
observations, data reduction, and analysis. In Section 3 we
compare the ISM properties and the occurrence of close (in-
teracting) companions to those found in other samples of
high-redshift AGN. We summarize our main ﬁndings in Sec-
tion 4. Throughout this work, we assume a cosmological
model with ΩΛ = 0.7, ΩM = 0.3, and H0 = 70kms−1 Mpc−1,
which provides an angular scale of about 6.47kpc/(cid:48)(cid:48) at z = 4.7
- the typical redshift of our sources. We further assume the
stellar initial mass function (IMF) of Chabrier (2003).

2. SAMPLE, ALMA OBSERVATIONS, AND DATA

ANALYSIS

2.1. Sample Selection and Properties

Our targets are drawn from a ﬂux-limited sample of 40 lu-
minous, unobscured quasars at z (cid:39) 4.8, which we have studied
in detail in a series of previous publications. Here, we only
brieﬂy mention the sample selection and the ancillary data
available for our targets and refer the reader to our previous
papers (T11, M12, N14) for additional details. This z (cid:39) 4.8
quasar sample was originally selected from the sixth data re-
lease of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS/DR6; York et al.
2000; Adelman-McCarthy et al. 2008). The sample spans a
narrow redshift range of z ∼ 4.65 − 4.92, to enable follow-
up near-IR spectroscopy of the broad Mg II λ 2798 emission
line. Such near-IR spectroscopy was indeed performed using
the VLT/SINFONI and Gemini-North/NIRI instruments and
has provided reliable estimates of the masses (MBH) and nor-
malized accretion rates (L/LEdd) of the quasars (T11). These
clearly showed that the z (cid:39) 4.8 quasars are powered by fast-
growing SMBHs with typical masses of MBH (cid:39) 8× 108 M(cid:12)
and accretion rates of L/LEdd (cid:39) 0.6 (median values), repre-
senting the epoch of fastest growth for the most massive BHs.

As the relevance of mergers to SMBH growth is still de-
bated, several recent studies have highlighted the importance
of alternatives to the merger scenario. Direct ﬂows of cold gas
from the intergalactic medium (IGM; e.g., Dekel et al. 2009;
Di Matteo et al. 2012; Dubois et al. 2012), which may also
trigger “secular” instabilities of the gas or the stars in the close
environment of the SMBH (e.g., Springel et al. 2005; Bour-
naud et al. 2011, 2012), are claimed to be most relevant for the
early and fast growth of high-redshift SMBHs. Such mod-
els, however, usually produce SFRs of only a few hundred
M(cid:12) yr−1. All this suggests that the best way to test and under-
stand the relevance of the merger-driven scenario for SMBH
growth is to focus on well-deﬁned samples of fast-growing
SMBHs, preferably at early cosmic epochs (z > 4), when the
most massive BHs were growing at maximal rates (Trakhten-
brot et al. 2011; Trakhtenbrot & Netzer 2012; De Rosa et al.
2014). Another consequence of the aforementioned scenar-
ios is that such fast-growing SMBHs would be predominantly
found in signiﬁcantly over-dense large-scale environments,
where the rate of mergers is yet higher and where cold gas
streams are expected to converge and provide ample gas sup-
ply to the SMBHs (e.g., Di Matteo et al. 2008; Sijacki et al.
2009; Dubois et al. 2012; Costa et al. 2014).

Testing these ideas observationally is, however, extremely
challenging. The AGN-related emission dominates over most
of the optical-NIR spectral regime, signiﬁcantly limiting the
prospects of determining the host properties. The cosmic en-
vironments of the SMBHs are often characterized by search-
ing for nearby (rest-frame) UV-bright galaxies, without pre-
cise redshift determinations, and possibly missing dusty ob-
scured SF galaxies. Indeed, several studies provided ambigu-
ous evidence for over-densities around some, but deﬁnitely
not all z (cid:38) 5 quasars (e.g., Willott et al. 2005; Overzier et al.
2006; Kim et al. 2009; Utsumi et al. 2010; Ba˜nados et al.
2013; Husband et al. 2013; Simpson et al. 2014, and refer-
ences therein).

The advent of large and sensitive sub-millimeter (sub-
mm) interferometric arrays, such as the IRAM Plateau de
Bure interferometer (now NOEMA) and the Atacama Large
Millimeter/sub-millimeter Array (ALMA), has enabled the
direct observation of the hosts of high-redshift quasars in a
spectral regime that is mostly uncontaminated by the AGN
emission. The early study of Iono et al. (2006, using the
SMA) demonstrated the ability of such data to reveal ma-
jor mergers among quasar hosts, presenting a close merger
between two z = 4.7 SF galaxies powering a pair of AGN,
one of which is a luminous quasar. The ALMA study of the
same system (Wagg et al. 2012) showcased the revolution-
ary increase of spatial resolution and sensitivity provided by
ALMA. In recent years, a growing number of z (cid:38) 5 quasars
were studied with various sub-mm facilities (e.g., Maiolino
et al. 2005; Walter et al. 2009; Gallerani et al. 2012; Vene-
mans et al. 2012, 2016; Wang et al. 2013; Willott et al. 2013,
2015; Cicone et al. 2015), focusing on the continuum emis-
sion, which originates from SF-heated dust in the interstel-
lar medium (ISM) of the hosts, and the [C II] λ 157.74 µm

A follow-up Herschel/SPIRE campaign targeted these
quasars, probing the peak of the SF-heated dust continuum
emission (M12, N14). These data provided robust contin-
uum detections for ∼1/4 of the quasars, with FIR luminosi-
ties of LFIR ∼ 2.4 × 1013 L(cid:12), suggesting SFRs in the range
∼ 1000−4000M(cid:12) yr−1. A stacking analysis of the remaining
∼3/4 of the quasars revealed a median SFR of ∼ 400M(cid:12) yr−1
(see the reﬁned stacking analysis in Netzer et al. 2016).
Importantly, these “FIR-bright” and “FIR-faint” sources are
highly uniform in terms of the SMBH-related properties that
drive the AGN emission (i.e., LAGN, MBH, and hence L/LEdd),
with a tendency of the FIR-bright sources to have somewhat
higher MBH and LAGN (by (cid:46)0.4 dex). Thus, the Herschel data
presented in M12 and N14 suggests a wide variety of SF activ-
ity among an almost uniform sample of fast-growing SMBHs
in the early universe, with SFRs that range over an order of
magnitude, compared with a signiﬁcantly narrower range of
basic SMBH properties. The N14 study also presented the re-
sults of a dedicated Spitzer/IRAC campaign targeting almost
all of the T11 quasars, at observed-frame 3.6 and 4.5 µm.
These data were used to derive positional priors that allowed
us to de-blend the low-resolution Herschel/SPIRE data.

A comparison of the FIR luminosities of the quasar hosts
(implied from the Herschel data) to the AGN-related lumi-
nosities (i.e., the bolometric luminosities from T11), implies
that the FIR-bright sources are so FIR-luminous, that they
reach LSF (cid:39) LAGN. The FIR-faint systems, on the other hand,
have LAGN (cid:38) 5× LSF, making them “AGN dominated”.
The current study focuses on six objects selected from our
parent T11 quasar sample, split equally between three FIR-
bright and three FIR-faint objects. We chose to focus on the
lower-redshift sources among our parent sample (z < 4.8) to
avoid the [C II] emission line to be redshifted into the low-
atmospheric transmission region near 325 GHz. The redshifts
of the selected targets are in the range z = 4.658−4.729, with
a median of zmedian = 4.6703 (as determined from the Mg II
lines; see Section 3.2 for more details). We will nonetheless
refer to them here as “z (cid:39) 4.8 quasars”, following our previ-
ous studies. The targets are all equatorial, so to allow efﬁ-
cient ALMA observations. In practice, this implies that the
NIR data for all the six quasars studied here were obtained
with the VLT/SINFONI. These redshift and declination re-
strictions leave only 4 of the 10 Herschel-detected, FIR-bright
quasars reported in N14, of which we ﬁnally chose 3. As for
the 3 FIR-faint targets, we focused on those with higher qual-
ity Mg II ﬁts, as assessed in T11.1 We stress that all these

selection criteria do not introduce any biases, in terms of the
a-priori known SMBH- and host-related properties of the sys-
tems under study. In particular, the MBH values of the two
sub-groups are consistent, within the errors (except for the
relatively high-mass object J1341; see Table 4).

2.2. Observations, Data Reduction and Analysis

2.2.1. ALMA Observations

The six targets were observed in ALMA band-7, as part
of cycle-2 (project code 2013.1.01153.S), during the period
2014 July 18 to 2015 June 13. As the capabilities of ALMA
were expanded during this period, the data presented here
were collected with a varying number of 12m antennas, be-
tween 29-38. The observations were set up to use the ex-
tended C34-4 conﬁguration, which provides a resolution of
about 0.(cid:48)(cid:48)3 at 330 GHz (corresponding to about 2 kpc at
z (cid:39) 4.8). We aimed at spectrally resolving the [C II] emission
line, which is expected to have a width of several hundred
km s−1 and also to cover a wide spectral range that includes
line-free continuum regions.

We chose to use the TDM correlator mode, providing four
spectral windows, each covering an effective bandwidth of
1875 MHz, corresponding to ∼ 1650kms−1 at the observed
frequencies. This spectral range is sampled by 128 channels,
providing a spectral resolution of ∼ 30kms−1. One such
spectral window was centered on the frequency correspond-
ing to the expected peak of the [C II] line, given the Mg II-
based redshifts of our targets (as determined in T11). The
other three bands extended to higher frequencies, with the ﬁrst
being adjacent to the [C II]-centered band and the other two
separated from this ﬁrst pair by about 12 GHz. Each of these
two pairs of bands included a small overlapping spectral re-
gion, of roughly 50 MHz. In addition, the rejection of a few
of the channels at the edge of the spectral bands, due to di-
vergent ﬂux values (a common ﬂagging procedure in ALMA
data reduction), implies that in some cases a small gap is seen
between windows. Given this spectral setup of four bands,
the ALMA observations could in principle probe [C II] line
emission over a spectral region with a width corresponding to
roughly ∆z (cid:39) 0.06.

Additional details regarding the ALMA observations, in-
cluding the full object names of our sources, are given in Ta-
ble 1. For clarity, we use abbreviated object names (i.e., “JH-
HDD”) throughout the rest of the paper.
The ALMA band-7 ﬂux densities reach a depth of Fν (cid:39)
(4.2− 9.2) × 10−2 mJy/beam (rms). This ﬂux limit can be
translated to a limit on our ability to detect dusty, SF galaxies,
at the redshift range of interest. If we assume the same gray-

the quasars’ optical emission (taken from the SDSS). Interacting companions, i.e. sources that have clear detections of [C II] with redshifts consistent with those
of the quasars, are marked as “SMG”. The continuum source accompanying J1511 that lacks signiﬁcant [C II] emission is marked as “B”.

body FIR spectral energy distribution (SED) as we do in our
analysis of the quasars hosts’ – a dust temperature of Td =
47K and a power-law exponent of β = 1.6, and the scaling
between FIR luminosity and SFR appropriate for our chosen
IMF (see Section 3.3), this corresponds to 3σ upper limits on
the SFR in the range ∼ 20 − 50M(cid:12) yr−1, per beam. Given
the beam sizes of our ALMA observations (Table 1), these
translate to ∼ 4− 11M(cid:12) yr−1/kpc2.

2.2.2. Data Reduction and Spectral Measurements

Data reduction was performed using CASA package, ver-
sion 4.5.0 (Mcmullin et al. 2007). The scripts provided by the
observatory were used to generate the visibilities. We then ap-
plied the CLEAN algorithm, using a “natural” weighting to de-
termine the noise level for each observation by averaging over
the three line-free spectral windows. The resulting ﬂux den-
sity sensitivities and synthesized beam sizes are presented in
Table 1. We note that self calibration for the brightest sources
did not improve the signal-to-noise ratios and therefore was
not implemented.

Both continuum and emission line images were created
by applying the CLEAN algorithm using a “briggs” weighting
(with robustness parameter set to 0.5), to obtain images with
the best possible spatial resolution. Continuum emission im-
ages were constructed using the two highest frequency, line-
free spectral windows. [C II] emission line images were con-
structed by subtracting the continuum emission from the other

two, lower frequency spectral windows, in the UV space (us-
ing standard CASA procedures). We veriﬁed that the resulting
[C II] emission line images have no residual continuum signal
in them. The sizes of the continuum- and line-emitting re-
gions were determined from the respective images by ﬁtting
two-dimensional Gaussians. These sizes are given in Table 2.
Velocity and velocity dispersion maps (i.e., second- and third-
moment maps) were obtained from the line images using the
standard CASA procedure.

The properties of the [C II] emission lines were mea-
sured from the two lower frequency spectral windows of the
continuum-subtracted “briggs” weighted cubes. The inte-
grated line ﬂuxes were measured through two different pro-
cedures.
In the ﬁrst (“spatial”) approach, we created zero-
moment images (i.e., integrated over the spectral axes) for all
sources and ﬁtted the spatial distribution of line emission with
2D Gaussian proﬁles, which are characterized by a peak line
ﬂux, semi-major and semi-minor axes, and a position angle.
The line ﬂuxes were measured by integrating over these spa-
tial 2D Gaussians. In the second (“spectral”) approach, we
extracted 1D spectra of the [C II] line from the continuum-
subtracted cubes. We used apertures that are based on the
aforementioned spatial 2D Gaussian proﬁles, with varying
radii ranging 1.5− 2× σ, where σ is the width (i.e., equiv-
alent to standard deviation) of the spatial 2D ﬁtted Gaussian
proﬁles. We then ﬁtted the emission line proﬁles with a sim-
ple model of a single Gaussian, from which we obtained the

around the [C II] line peak, for the three quasars lacking a robust companion (i.e., J0331, J1341, and J0935). For systems with a companion SMGs, the spectral
band spans ± (500 +|∆v|) kms−1 around the mean [C II] peak frequency of the quasar and the SMG, where ∆v is the velocity separation between the line peaks.
The ALMA beams are shown as red ellipses near the bottom-right of each panel. Red crosses mark the locations of the quasars’ optical emission (taken from the
SDSS). Interacting companions, i.e. sources that have clear detections of [C II] with redshifts consistent with those of the quasars, are marked as “SMG”. The
continuum source accompanying J1511 that lacks signiﬁcant [C II] emission is marked as “B”.

integrated line ﬂux. The [C II] line ﬂuxes obtained using the
two methods are in good agreement, with differences of no
more than 0.1 dex for the six quasar hosts (median difference
of 0.05 dex). We eventually chose to adopt the line ﬂuxes
measured through the former, “spatial” approach, as it is less
sensitive to the low-S/N regions in the outer extended regions
of the sources and/or the wings of the line proﬁles, and since
it provides more realistic uncertainties. These line ﬂuxes are
reported in Table 2.

The best-ﬁt emission line proﬁles obtained through the lat-
ter (“spectral”) approach allow us to obtain the [C II] line cen-
ters, and therefore [C II]-based redshifts, as well as the line
widths (see Table 2 and Table 3). We stress that the centers
of the [C II] line proﬁles were treated as free parameters and
not constrained to reﬂect the previously known redshifts of
the quasars. We also note that for four of the quasar hosts, the
[C II] line is observed near the edge of the spectral band, due
to the differences between the redshifts based on AGN-line-
and host-ISM-related emission regions (see Section 3.2). The
line widths we measure for the quasar hosts are in the range
FWHM [C II] ∼ 240−510kms−1, with a tendency for broader
lines among the FIR-bright sources (see discussion in Section
3.3). The formal uncertainties on line width measurements
are of order of 10% (i.e., ∼ 10− 40kms−1).

3. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

3.1. Source detection and identiﬁcation

Figure 1 presents the full-scale continuum emission maps
of the sources, extending to about 6.(cid:48)(cid:48)8 (∼45 kpc) from the
quasars’ locations, and Figure 2 shows the equivalent [C II]
line emission maps. All six quasar hosts are clearly detected
in our new ALMA data, both in continuum and in [C II] line
emission, with the least signiﬁcant [C II] detection having
S/N∼4.5 (for J0935; see Table 2). The [C II] spectra of the
quasar hosts are shown in Figure 3 (together with the compan-
ions we discuss below). We note that the central frequencies
of the [C II] lines are shifted, by several hundreds of km s−1,
from the redshifts determined using the quasars’ broad UV
emission lines (i.e., Hewett & Wild 2010). We discuss this in
more detail in Section 3.2 below.

For one of the FIR-bright sources, J1511,

the ALMA
data reveal two faint sub-mm-emitting apparent companions,
which are detected at the 7-8σ level in continuum emission.
Their centers are spatially separated from the quasar host by
about 2.(cid:48)(cid:48)1 and 3.(cid:48)(cid:48)9, which corresponds to 14 and 25 kpc (see
Table 2). These two sources are fainter than the quasar host,
in the ALMA continuum data, by at least a factor of 5. Most
importantly, we detect signiﬁcant [C II] line emission from

the companion closer to the quasar host, as seen in Figures 2
and 4. The integrated [C II] line ﬂux suggests that the detec-
tion is signiﬁcant at the ∼ 3.5σ level. The spectrum we ex-
tract for this companion (Figure 3) demonstrates that the line
emission, if associated with a redshifted [C II] transition, is
shifted by ∼75 km s−1 from the [C II] line of the correspond-
ing quasar host (see Table 2). We do not detect any signiﬁcant
[C II] line emission from the other, more distant continuum
source accompanying J1511. Moreover, we do not detect any
other signiﬁcant emission in the multi-wavelength data avail-
able for the z (cid:39) 4.8 quasars, for any of these two companions
of J1511. This may suggest that the most distant source seen
in the ALMA maps of J1511 is a projected companion source,
not physically related with the J1511 system. However, given
the low probability of observing such a (second) faint sub-mm
source within a single ALMA pointing (see below), it may be
indeed tracing a faint, low-mass, and/or low-SFR galaxy that

is associated with the quasar host. In such a case, the observed
properties suggest that it would be a minor merger. This lat-
ter interpretation is further justiﬁed by our ﬁndings of clearly
interacting companions, both for J1511 and two of the FIR-
faint quasar systems, as described below.
In particular, we
note that the interacting companions show clear [C II] emis-
sion, while the distant companion of J1511 does not, despite
having comparable FIR continuum ﬂuxes.

We identify two additional emission sources in the maps of
two of the FIR-faint sources, J0923 and J1328 – one around
each of these quasars – which are clearly detected in the
ALMA continuum maps. These sources are detected at signif-
icance levels of ∼ 3− 4σ, and have continuum ﬂux densities
of 1.2 and 0.7 mJy (for the companions of J0923 and J1328,
respectively). The centers of these accompanying sources
are located 5.(cid:48)(cid:48)6 and 6.(cid:48)(cid:48)8 from the quasars hosts, correspond-
ing to about 36.5 and 44.5 kpc. These two accompanying

sources show associated [C II] line emission, as seen in the
bottom panels of Figure 2 (and also of Figure 4). Similarly
to the companion of J1511 described above, the spectra we
extract for these two companions (Figure 3) demonstrate that
the [C II] line emission is shifted by less than ∼450 km s−1
from the [C II] lines of the corresponding quasar hosts. We
ﬁnally note that, similarly to the aforementioned companion
of J1511, these two sources are not associated with any other
(signiﬁcant) emission in the multi-wavelength dataset we have
available for the z (cid:39) 4.8 quasars, particularly the Spitzer data
(at observed-frame 3.6 and 4.5 µm; N14). The (projected)
spatial and velocity offsets of all companions are given in Ta-
ble 2.

Figure 4 presents smaller-scale continuum and line emis-
sion maps of all the spectroscopically conﬁrmed systems we
identify. The regions where the continuum and line emission
is signiﬁcantly detected are resolved by a few synthesized
beams, in all sources. As can be clearly seen, the peaks of
the [C II] line emission coincides with the peaks of the dust-
dominated continuum emission. In the quasars hosts, these
peaks of continuum and [C II] emission are also consistent
with the locations of the quasars, to within 0.(cid:48)(cid:48)1, as determined
from the SDSS optical imaging.

Before moving on with our analysis of the properties of our
quasar hosts and companions and our interpretation of these
detections in the context of major galaxy mergers (Section
3.4), we would like to emphasize that the sheer detection of
three (and possibly four) faint sub-mm companion sources
within our ALMA data are, by itself, highly surprising. The
faintest continuum sources in our data (regardless of [C II] de-
tection) have ﬂux densities on the order of ∼0.5 mJy. Based
on recent deep (ALMA) sub-mm surveys (e.g., Karim et al.
2013; Carniani et al. 2015; Aravena et al. 2016a; Fujimoto
et al. 2016, and references therein), we would expect on or-
der of ∼0.1 such sources per ALMA pointing (i.e., a circu-
lar ﬁeld of view of 18(cid:48)(cid:48)). UV-selected, z ∼ 4.8 SF galaxies
are yet more rare. The most recent measurements of areal
densities in deep ﬁelds imply that on the order of 0.01 galax-
ies with SFR ∼ 100M(cid:12) yr−1 would be observed within a sin-
gle ALMA band-7 pointing (Stark et al. 2009; Bouwens et al.
2015). Most, but not all such galaxies would have [C II] detec-
tions (e.g., Capak et al. 2015; Aravena et al. 2016b) Number
counts of purely [C II]-emitting z (cid:38) 5 galaxies are highly un-
certain, but would probably amount to roughly 0.06 galaxy

per each ALMA pointing (e.g., Aravena et al. 2016b). Thus,
based on deep (sub-mm) surveys that are designed to detect
high-redshift SF galaxies – our robust detection of continuum-
emitting companions in the ﬁelds surrounding three of the
quasar hosts cannot be attributed to chance coincidence. Ob-
viously, the robust detection of [C II] in three of these com-
panions further strengths this conclusion.

We conclude that the host galaxies of all six quasars are
clearly detected in the new ALMA data, in both continuum
and [C II] line emission. We identify three sub-mm galax-
ies (SMGs hereafter) accompanying three of the quasar sys-
tems - one FIR-bright and two FIR-faint (one SMG accom-
panying each of these quasars). The companion SMGs are
located between roughly 14 and 45 kpc (projected) from
the quasars, with relatively small velocity offsets, |∆v| <
450kms−1. The three companion [C II]-emitting SMGs –
detected solely through the new ALMA data – are therefore
physically related to, and interacting with the quasar systems.
We ﬁnally note that no additional line-emitting sources were
found in our ALMA data.

3.2. [C II] emission line properties

As clearly seen in Figure 3, the [C II] lines we measure in
our sample are often offset towards the lower frequency edge
of the observed bands - redshifted with respect to the rest-
frame UV emission lines of the quasars. Table 3 compares the
redshifts determined from the [C II] line to those determined
from the Mg II line and also the enhanced SDSS-based red-
shift determinations published in Hewett & Wild (2010). The
Mg II line is believed to be among the best redshift indica-
tors for unobscured AGN, with a scatter of about 200 km s−1
compared to the systemic redshift (e.g., Richards et al. 2002;
Shen et al. 2016, and references therein). We note that for
our z (cid:39) 4.8 quasars the SDSS-based redshift determinations
rely solely on the (rest-frame) UV lines Lyα and C IV λ 1549,
both of which may be problematic for the purpose of redshift
determinations. The C IV line is known to present signiﬁcant
blueshifts with respect to systemic redshifts (e.g., Shang et al.
2007; Richards et al. 2011; Shen et al. 2016, and references
therein), while the proﬁle of the Lyα line, and particularly the
blue wing, is affected by IGM absorption (e.g., Becker et al.
2013).

All quasar hosts present signiﬁcant shifts of the [C II] lines,
compared to the broad UV emission lines of the quasars. The

the three “FIR-bright” sources in our sample (top row), the three “FIR-faint” sources (middle row), and the accompanying SMGs (bottom row). For each source,
the gray-scale map traces the continuum emission, while the contours trace the [C II] line emission (i.e., surface brightness) at signiﬁcance levels of 3, 6, 9, 12,
and 15−σ. For each source, the line ﬂuxes used for the contours were extracted from a spectral window spanning ±500kms−1 around the [C II] line peak. Red

panel.

three FIR-bright hosts and one of the FIR-faint ones (J0935)
show [C II] emission redshifted by ∼ 390− 580kms−1. In-
terestingly, the only sources presenting [C II] blueshifts, of
∼ 220 and 630kms−1, are the two FIR-faint sources, J0923
and J1328 respectively, which have interacting SMGs. Such
signiﬁcant positive velocity shifts of ISM lines, such as [C II],
with respect to the quasar’s broad emission lines, such as
Mg II– which probe the close vicinity of the SMBHs, are not
uncommon in high-redshift quasars. For example, the recent

study of Venemans et al. (2016) shows [C II] velocity shifts of
∼ 370− 1690kms−1 in a compilation of seven z > 6 quasars.
Willott et al. (2015) found a shift of ∼ 1150kms−1 for one
z (cid:39) 6 quasar, but no signiﬁcant shift for another. Negative
velocity shifts of several hundred km s−1 were also observed
among other high-redshift quasars (e.g., Wang et al. 2013;
Willott et al. 2013).

Figure 5 shows the [C II] velocity maps of the six quasar
hosts and the three SMGs accompanying J1511, J0923 and

quasars’ optical emission (taken from the SDSS). Gray circles mark the locations of the peak of the dust (ALMA) continuum emission. Black circles mark the

J1328. The relatively smooth gradients suggest that the [C II]
emission originates from a kiloparsec scale, rotating gas struc-
ture, with a rotation axis that coincides with the centers of
the galaxies and with the quasars themselves (as shown by
the centroid markers). The only obvious outlier is the host
of J0935, where the [C II] emission is weaker. For the FIR-
bright quasar hosts, the velocity maps reach maximal velocity
values of |vmax| (cid:39) 200kms−1, while for the FIR-faint hosts
and their accompanying SMGs the corresponding values are
signiﬁcantly lower, |vmax| (cid:39) 100kms−1. This may suggest

that the FIR-bright quasar hosts are more massive, or gas rich,
than the FIR-faint ones.

The velocity dispersion maps, presented in Figure 6, show
increased velocity dispersions in the centers of all [C II]-
emitting systems, reaching σv ∼ 100kms−1. Given the beam
sizes of our ALMA data, this trend is probably mostly driven
by the effects of beam smearing, as demonstrated in several
detailed studies of the kinematics of high-redshift, sub-mm
sources (e.g., De Breuck et al. 2014). A clear signature of
this effect is a centrally peaked velocity dispersion, elongated
along the minor axis of rotation - which is similar to what is

seen in some of our sources (e.g., J1341, J1511 and J0923).
Thus, the real underlying central velocity dispersions may be
signiﬁcantly lower than what is seen in Figure 6, resulting
in generally more uniform or ﬂatter velocity dispersion pro-
ﬁles, and thus implying rotation-dominated kinematics with
v/σv (cid:38) 1. We note that even in such a situation, of v/σv on the
order of a few, the kinematics may be signiﬁcantly affected by
a turbulent component, as demonstrated in several recent stud-
ies of resolved ISM kinematics in high-redshift galaxies (e.g.,
Gnerucci et al. 2011; Williams et al. 2014). With these limi-
tations in mind, we cautiously conclude that the outer parts of

the [C II]-emitting regions in all sources are dominated by ro-
tation, with v/σv > 1. In particular, this is the case in the outer
high-velocity regions of the FIR-bright systems, where one
could have expected to see evidence for dispersion-dominated
gas kinematics in the case these systems were driven by major
mergers.

We next turn to the relative [C II] line strength, traced by
the ratio between [C II] line luminosity and the continuum
(rest-frame) FIR luminosity, L[C II]/LFIR. Figure 7 shows
L[C II]/LFIR vs. LFIR for the six quasar hosts and the three

interacting SMGs in our sample, as well as a large compila-
tion of other galaxies where the [C II] line was detected. The
compilation, adapted from Cicone et al. (2015), includes in-
active star forming galaxies at low and intermediate redshifts
(from Stacey et al. 2010; D´ıaz-Santos et al. 2013) and SMGs
and quasar hosts at z > 4 (from Maiolino et al. 2009; Ivison
et al. 2010; Wagg et al. 2010; Cox et al. 2011; Valtchanov
et al. 2011; Swinbank et al. 2012; Venemans et al. 2012,
2016; Carniani et al. 2013; Riechers et al. 2013, 2014; Wang
et al. 2013; Willott et al. 2013; De Breuck et al. 2014; Neri
et al. 2014). For the purpose of this comparative analysis, we
calculated the FIR luminosities assuming a gray-body SED
with a dust temperature of Td = 47K and a power-law ex-
ponent of β = 1.6, scaled to match the continuum emission
of each of the ALMA-detected sources. These scaled SEDs
are then used to calculate the integrated luminosity between
42.5 − 122.5 µm, LFIR (42.5− 122.5). As mentioned in Ci-
cone et al. (2015), the measurements of the sources in the
compilation were also scaled, to provide consistent estimates
of LFIR (42.5− 122.5). We present a more detailed analysis
of the FIR SEDs of our sources in Section 3.3.1 below.
For the quasar hosts, the L[C II]/LFIR ratio is in the range of
(2.1− 9.4)× 10−4, spanning a factor of roughly 4.5. As Fig-
ure 7 shows, the FIR-bright and FIR-faint quasar hosts form a
trend of decreasing L[C II]/LFIR with increasing LFIR, although
the range of L[C II]/LFIR for the two sub-samples overlaps.
Since all quasar hosts have comparable L[C II], this trend of de-
creasing L[C II]/LFIR is mostly driven by the increase in LFIR.
The three interacting SMGs follow the same trend, extend-
ing to lower LFIR and higher L[C II]/LFIR. We further veriﬁed
that the trend of decreasing line-to-continuum ratio with in-
creasing FIR luminosity is also reﬂected in the [C II] equiva-
lent widths (EWs; instead of L[C II]/LFIR; see, e.g., Sargsyan
et al. 2014). The EWs of our quasar hosts are in the range
EW[C II] (cid:39) 0.2−0.9 µm (∼ 370−1700kms−1) and follow the
same trend with (continuum) FIR luminosity as that found for
L[C II]/LFIR – dropping by about 0.65 dex in EW for a 1 dex
increase in (monochromatic) FIR luminosity. The companion
SMGs extend this trend to EW[C II] (cid:39) 2.4 µm..
Several recent studies have demonstrated the wide range of
possible L[C II]/LFIR in z (cid:38) 5 (UV-selected) SF galaxies, cov-
ering L[C II]/LFIR ∼ 0.0002 − 0.02 - similar to the range ob-
served at lower redshifts (e.g., Capak et al. 2015; Knudsen
et al. 2016). Thus, the so-called “[C II] deﬁcit” observed in
high-redshift SMGs and quasar hosts is most probably not re-
lated to simple observational selection effects in the FIR or
sub-mm regime, but rather to the morphology of the SF ac-

tative measurement (black) and systematic (gray) uncertainties related to LFIR
and L[C II]. We plot LFIR systematics of 0.15 dex, reﬂecting the range covered
by the different FIR SEDs we use (i.e., gray-body and template-based; see
Section 3.3.1 for details). We note that the ratios we measure for the FIR-
bright quasar hosts are among the lowest measured to date, particularly at
high redshifts. The interacting quasar hosts have lower L[C II]/LFIR than what
is found for the companion SMGs of the same systems.

tivity. Speciﬁcally, high-redshift quasar hosts exhibit more
compact starburst-like SF activity, with L[C II]/LFIR ratios as
low as observed in lower-redshift ULIRGs.

Interestingly, our measurements show that the L[C II]/LFIR
ratio in the three interacting quasar hosts is signiﬁcantly lower
than that found in their companion SMGs. Speciﬁcally, we
ﬁnd that the L[C II]/LFIR ratio in the quasar hosts of J1511,
J0923, and J1328 is lower by factors of about 1.7, 3 and 2.9,
respectively, compared with the companion SMGs. As can
be clearly seen in Figure 7, this is consistent with the general
trend of decreasing L[C II]/LFIR with increasing LFIR, observed
for our entire sample of quasar hosts and SMGs. Moreover,
this demonstrates that the [C II]-deﬁcit in high-redshift quasar
hosts is driven by local properties of the ISM and the UV ra-
diation ﬁeld within the host galaxies, and not by larger scale
effects. Indeed, several studies have emphasized that lower
L[C II]/LFIR ratios are expected to be found in regions with
higher SF densities, similar to starbursts – consistent with
what is observed (e.g., D´ıaz-Santos et al. 2013; see discussion
in Cicone et al. 2015). However, the ALMA data for some
of our sources do not seem to support this explanation.
In
particular, the hosts of J1328 and J0935 have virtually identi-
cal LFIR and [C II]-emitting region sizes, but L[C II] (and there-

Thin dotted lines trace alternative SEDs with Td = 50, 55, and 60 K (and for J0331 also 65 K; all with β = 1.6). Thick dashed lines illustrate the best-ﬁtting FIR

fore L[C II]/LFIR) in J1328 is twice as high as in J0935. Simi-
larly, the hosts of J0331 and J0923 have very similar LFIR, and
L[C II]/LFIR in the latter is higher than in the former by merely
30%. However, the [C II]-emitting region in J0923 is larger
by a factor of roughly four than the one in J0331. Thus, our
ALMA data do not seem to support a simple scenario where
L[C II]/LFIR is mainly controlled by the size of the [C II] emit-
ting region, however, higher resolution data are needed to crit-
ically address this idea.

3.3. Host galaxy properties
3.3.1. FIR SEDs and SFRs

The (rest-frame) FIR continuum emission observed within
the new ALMA data can be used to estimate the total FIR
emission and therefore the SFR of the quasar hosts and the
accompanying SMGs. This obviously requires additional as-
sumptions regarding the shape of the FIR SED. We expect
that the AGN-related contribution to the FIR SED is small, on
the level of 10%, at most. This assumption is based on sev-
eral detailed studies of the mid-to-far IR SEDs of luminous
AGN across a wide luminosity range (e.g., Schweitzer et al.
2006; Netzer et al. 2007; Mor & Netzer 2012; Rosario et al.
2012; Netzer et al. 2014, 2016; Lutz et al. 2016), although we

note that other studies have suggested a higher AGN contribu-
tion at FIR wavelengths, particularly at high AGN luminosi-
ties (e.g., Leipski et al. 2014; Schneider et al. 2015; Syme-
onidis et al. 2016; Symeonidis 2017). Given the uncertainties
related to the SED shape (see below) and in order to be consis-
tent with other ALMA studies of high-redshift quasar hosts,
we choose to neglect the (small) possible AGN contribution
to the FIR SEDs of our sources.

We have reconstructed the FIR SEDs of our sources follow-
ing two different approaches. First, we adopted the procedure
used in several recent studies of FIR emission in high-redshift
quasar hosts (e.g., Willott et al. 2015; Venemans et al. 2016,
and references therein) and have assumed a gray-body SED
with dust temperature Td = 47K and β = 1.6. This single
temperature dust model is a crude approximation to the more
realistic case where dust with a range of temperatures con-
tribute to the observed emission (for a detailed discussion see,
e.g., Beelen et al. 2006; Magnelli et al. 2012, and references
therein). Second, we have used the grid of FIR SEDs pro-
vided by Chary & Elbaz (2001, CE01 hereafter). This grid in-
cludes 105 templates spanning a wide range in IR luminosity.
As the templates have no free parameters2, we have simply

identiﬁed the template that best matches the ALMA contin-
uum measurement (i.e., monochromatic luminosity) for each
source. This also provides a speciﬁc value of total IR (TIR)
luminosity, LTIR (8− 1000 µm). In the FIR luminosity regime
of interest, the uncertainties on the ALMA continuum mea-
surements are typically consistent with, or smaller than, the
differences between adjacent FIR templates. The main lim-
itation of this approach is that the template library was con-
structed to account for low-redshift SF galaxies. However, the
small number of available data points does not warrant the use
of other sets of templates.

In Figure 8 we present the ALMA continuum measure-
ments and the Herschel data from N14, along with the two
previously mentioned types of FIR SEDs. The low spatial
resolution of the Herschel data means that these ﬂux mea-
surements also include the emission from any accompanying
continuum sources for the systems where these are resolved
by ALMA. We therefore also show in Figure 8 a scaled-down
version of the Herschel data points, assuming the relative ﬂux
densities of the different neighboring sources follow those of
the ALMA measurements. As Figure 8 shows, the gray-body
SEDs are generally in good agreement with the previous Her-
schel data. In particular, in the observed-frame 350 µm band
(rest-frame wavelength of roughly 60 µm), the ALMA-based
SEDs for two of the FIR-bright systems (J1341 and J1511)
differ from the Herschel data by less than 0.05 dex (for either
the gray-body or CE01 SEDs). For the third FIR-bright ob-
ject, J0331, the luminosities expected from the ALMA-based
SEDs are signiﬁcantly lower, by factors of about 2 and 3, than
the ﬂuxes observed with Herschel for the gray-body and CE01
SEDs, respectively.3 Since this source has no detectable com-
panions in the ALMA data, we suggest that this discrepancy
can only be attributed to the uncertainty on the exact shape of
the SED, and perhaps to the limited quality of the Herschel
data. Below we investigate how a gray-body SED with a dif-
ferent (higher) temperature may account for this discrepancy.
the comparison between the
ALMA-based SEDs and the Herschel data is obviously less
straightforward, as the Herschel data represent the stacked
signal coming from a much larger sample of sources for which
the existence of companions that may contribute to the FIR
ﬂuxes is unclear. Nonetheless, the agreement between the
new ALMA data and the Herschel stacking measurements
is respectable. For two of the sources (J1328 and J0935),
the ALMA-based gray-body SEDs are consistent within 0.13
dex of the Herschel data (again at observed-frame 350 µm).
For the third source (J0923), the gray-body SED over-predicts
the luminosity at 350 µm by 0.37 dex, while the CE01 SED
agrees with the Herschel data to within less than 0.1 dex. As
a sanity check, if one ignores the scaling factors related to the
companions (in J0923 and J1328), that is - assume that the
stacked Herschel signal was not signiﬁcantly affected by com-
panions, then the differences between the ALMA-based gray-
body SEDs and the Herschel data become somewhat smaller.
We have also experimented with both colder and warmer
gray-body SEDs, always “anchored” to the new ALMA data.
The colder SEDs, with Td = 40K and β = 1.5, identical
to those used in N14, systematically under-predict the Her-
schel data, by 0.1-0.3 dex (at 350 µm; the discrepancies ob-
viously decrease at observed-frame 500 µm). Among the
warmer SEDs, shown as dotted lines in Figure 8, we note

For the FIR-faint sources,

3 Similarly, the CE01 template that ﬁts the Herschel data alone (as reported

in N14) over-predicts the ALMA ﬂux by a factor of 2.4.

that an extremely warm gray-body with Td = 65K provides
a better agreement between the ALMA and the Herschel data
for J0331. However, this high temperature is beyond what
is typically observed, even among the most luminous FIR
sources (e.g., Lee et al. 2013; Magnelli et al. 2014, and ref-
erences therein). This may suggest that, in this source, the
radiation emerging from the vicinity of the SMBH does con-
tribute to heating of galaxy-scale dust, which is not associ-
ated with SF regions in the host (e.g., Schneider et al. 2015).
We also note that choosing a higher-luminosity template from
the CE01 grid would not resolve the discrepancy between
the ALMA and Herschel data for this source, as the highest-
luminosity CE01 template that closely matches the Herschel
data would signiﬁcantly over-predict the ALMA continuum
measurement. We conclude that both the CE01 and ﬁducial
gray-body FIR SEDs (i.e., with Td = 47K and β = 1.6) pro-
vide generally good agreement between the ALMA and Her-
schel data. We therefore chose to use these sets of SEDs in
what follows.
We next use the two types of FIR SEDs to calculate the to-
tal IR luminosities between 8−1000 µm, LTIR (8− 1000 µm)
for all sources – both quasar hosts and accompany-
ing SMGs.4
From these, we estimate SFRs following
SFR/M(cid:12) yr−1 = LTIR (8− 1000 µm) /1010 L(cid:12) (following the
assumed Chabrier IMF). Importantly, we note that the agree-
ment between the integrated TIR luminosities obtained with
the two types of SEDs is remarkably good. For the six quasar
hosts, the LTIR estimates based on the CE01 template SEDs
are lower than those based on gray-body SEDs by merely
0.1 dex (median value). For the three interacting SMGs, the
difference is only slightly larger, ∼0.13 dex. The SFRs we
obtain for the quasar hosts following this procedure span a
wide range of ∼ 260− 3040M(cid:12) yr−1 for the gray-body SEDs
or ∼ 190− 3530M(cid:12) yr−1 for the CE01 SEDs (see Table 4).
The SFRs of the FIR-faint sources, ∼ 260− 490M(cid:12) yr−1 (or
190 − 360M(cid:12) yr−1 using CE01), are in excellent agreement
with the value found from stacking analysis performed in
N14, using all the Herschel-undetected sources in the parent
z (cid:39) 4.8 sample, of roughly 440M(cid:12) yr−1 (see also Netzer et al.
2016 for a slightly lower value). As noted above, the low
spatial resolution Herschel stack included the FIR emission
from both the quasar hosts and the accompanying SMGs. The
total SFRs of the different sub-components in the FIR-faint
systems (∼ 680, 390, and 260M(cid:12) yr−1) are, again, consistent
with the stacking result. For the FIR-bright sources, the SFRs
we derive based on the ALMA data are high, ranging from
∼ 710− 3040M(cid:12) yr−1 for the ﬁducial gray-body FIR SEDs
or ∼ 630− 3530M(cid:12) yr−1 for the CE01 ones. We note that the
lowest SFRs among this sub-sample are those of J0331, where
an extremely warm gray-body SED is required to match the
Herschel data. Using the Td = 65K gray-body SED we ob-
tain log (LTIR/L(cid:12)) = 13.35 and SFR = 2225M(cid:12) yr−1. These
SFRs are in excellent agreement with those derived in N14,
when comparing similar SEDs. The differences between the
CE01-based IR luminosities (and therefore SFRs) among the
FIR-bright quasar hosts are of 0.1 dex, at most. If we instead
consider the gray-body SEDs used in N14, which assumed
Td = 40K and β = 1.5, and employ these SED parameters to
our ALMA data, then the resulting SFRs are, again, in ex-
cellent agreement with the N14 ones for two of the systems
4 We also use these SEDs to calculate LFIR (42.5− 122.5), as mentioned

in Section 3.2.

(J1341 and J1511). As mentioned above, such a cold SED is
inconsistent with the data available for J0331, and the ALMA-
based LFIR for this source is lower than the one obtained in
N14 by 0.4 dex.

We conclude that the new ALMA continuum measurements
are broadly consistent with the Herschel-based ones (pre-
sented in N14) and indicate that all quasar hosts and accom-
panying SMGs harbor signiﬁcant SF activity. The exact val-
ues of SFR obviously depend on the assumed shape of the
FIR SED, but are in good agreement with the ones derived
from the Herschel data. The only outlier is the FIR-bright
system J0331, where the ALMA-based FIR SED and SFR es-
timates are found to be considerably lower than the Herschel-
based ones. Despite these systematic uncertainties, the new
ALMA data strongly support the picture that the FIR-bright
sources among the T11 sample of z (cid:39) 4.8 quasars have ex-
treme SFRs, exceeding ∼ 1000M(cid:12) yr−1, while the FIR-faint
sources have lower, though still intense SFRs, on the order of
∼ 200− 400M(cid:12) yr−1.
Most star-forming galaxies are found to populate the so-
called “main sequence of star formation” on the SFR-M∗
plane (SF-MS hereafter). Although this relation is not yet
well established at z > 4, the most recent results from deep
surveys suggest a relation of roughly

M(cid:12) yr−1 ,

SFR (cid:39) 300

(1)
with an intrinsic scatter of ∼ 0.2 − 0.3 dex (e.g., Lee et al.
2012; Speagle et al. 2014; Steinhardt et al. 2014). The SFRs
we ﬁnd for the FIR-faint quasar hosts, and for the companion
SMGs, are therefore consistent with those of typical massive,
high-redshift SF galaxies, with M∗ (cid:39) 1011 M(cid:12). Several recent
studies have highlighted the fact that such SFRs can be sus-
tained without invoking major mergers and instead be driven
by the accretion of cold gas onto these galaxies (e.g., Bouch´e
et al. 2010; Lilly et al. 2013). On the other hand, it is challeng-
ing to account for the extremely high SFRs found for the FIR-
bright sources by assuming MS hosts. Such an assumption
would require stellar masses in excess of ∼ 5×1011 M(cid:12). This
would imply that the quasar hosts are among the most mas-
sive and rarest galaxies ever observed, at any redshift (e.g.,
Baldry et al. 2012; Ilbert et al. 2013), with number densities
on the order of Φ <∼ 10−6 − 10−5 Mpc−3 at z ∼ 5 (e.g., Dun-
can et al. 2014; Stefanon et al. 2015). In this context, we note
that the quasars we study here are among the most luminous
in the universe (by selection) and therefore also represent a
population of rare objects, with number densities on the or-
der of Φ <∼ 10−8 Mpc−3 (e.g., Richards et al. 2006; McGreer
et al. 2013). Alternatively, it is possible that the FIR-bright
sources are hosted in galaxies with masses that are compara-
ble to those of the FIR-faint systems, but located well above
the SF-MS. Such systems are typically associated with short
periods of intense starburst activity.
In particular, SFRs on
the order of > 1000M(cid:12) yr−1 are often observed in “classical”
(i.e., luminous) SMGs, where they are attributed to late stages
of major mergers of massive gas-rich galaxies (see, e.g., the
recent review by Casey et al. 2014, and references therein).
In the next section we use the available [C II] data to con-
strain the (dynamical) masses of the quasar hosts, and of their
companions, and return to the question of their location in
the SFR-mass plane. We discuss the relevance of the major
merger interpretation for our sample in Section 3.4.

3.3.2. Host and companion galaxy masses

The [C II] measurements may be used to estimate the dy-
namical masses (Mdyn) of the quasar host galaxies and the
companion SMGs. For this purpose, we employ the same
prescription as used in several recent studies of [C II] (and
CO) emission in high-redshift sources, which assumes the
ISM is arranged in an inclined, rotating disk (e.g., Wang et al.
2013; Willott et al. 2015; Venemans et al. 2016, and refer-
ences therein):

sin2 (i) M(cid:12) .
(2)
In this prescription, D[C II] is the size (deconvolved major axis)
of the [C II]-emitting region (as tabulated in Table 2). The
sin (i) term reﬂects the inclination angle between the line of
sight and the polar axis of the hosts’ gas disks, in which the
circular velocity is given by vcirc = 0.75 × FWHM/sin (i).
Practically, under the assumption of an inclined disk, the incli-
nation angle is often derived from the (resolved) morphology

of the line-emitting region, following cos (i) =(cid:0)amin/amaj

where amin and amaj are the semi-minor and semi-major axes
of the [C II] emitting regions, respectively.

Such dynamical mass estimates carry signiﬁcant uncertain-
ties due to the different assumptions required to derive them
and given the kind of data available for our systems. In partic-
ular, our ALMA data may not be able to detect the more ex-
tended lower surface brightness [C II]-emitting regions, thus
underestimating D[C II], and consequently Mdyn. In this sense,
the Mdyn estimates derived from our ALMA data would only
trace the very central [C II]-emitting regions, on scales of a
few kiloparsecs. Faint extended [C II] emission may also af-
fect the inclination corrections, though this would probably be
a subtle effect. More importantly, the inclination corrections
for marginally resolved extended sources are somewhat sen-
sitive to non-circular beam shapes, as is the case with some
of our data. On the other hand, deeper and higher resolu-
tion data may also reveal non-rotating ISM components, thus
signiﬁcantly altering the Mdyn estimates. As noted in Sec-
tion 3.2, the high central velocity dispersions we observe in
our sources are most probably driven by the limited spatial
resolution of our ALMA data and not by such non-rotating
components. Even if the ISM is indeed mostly found in a ro-
tating disk, then determining the underlying (central) veloc-
ity dispersion would result in lower vcirc, and therefore lower
Mdyn. Some of these effects are clearly demonstrated when-
ever increasingly deeper observations were obtained for some
z (cid:38) 5 sub-mm sources (e.g., Maiolino et al. 2012; Cicone et al.
2015 for J1148 at z = 6.4; Gallerani et al. 2012 for BRI 0952-
0115 at z = 4.4; and Carniani et al. 2013 for BR 1202-0725 at
z = 4.7). A more detailed discussion of these, and other un-
certainties related to Mdyn estimates, is also given in Valiante
et al. (2014).

Notwithstanding these uncertainties and caveats, we pro-
ceed to estimate the dynamical masses of the sources in our
sample, using the prescription given in Equation 2. For
the quasar hosts, the dynamical masses are in the range of
Mdyn sin2 (i) (cid:39) (1− 4.4)× 1010 M(cid:12) (see Table 4). The three
companion SMGs have Mdyn sin2 (i) = 5.8 × 1010, 1.57 ×
1010, and 6.6× 1010 M(cid:12) for the SMGs accompanying J1511,
J0923, and J1328, respectively. We further derive rough es-
timates of the inclination angles based on the observed mor-

phology of the [C II] emission in all [C II]-emitting systems
(given in Table 2). For the quasar host of J1511 and the
accompanying SMG, where the [C II]-emitting regions are
not formally resolved, we use the upper limits on amin and
amax. The inclination angles we deduce for our sources are
in the range i ∼ 28 − 80deg. Taking these inclination cor-
rections into account, we obtain dynamical masses of Mdyn (cid:39)
(3.7− 7.5)×1010 M(cid:12) for the quasar hosts, while for the com-
panion SMGs we have Mdyn = 6 × 1010, 2.1 × 1010, and
10.7× 1010 M(cid:12) (for the SMGs accompanying J1511, J0923,
and J1328, respectively). We ﬁnd no signiﬁcant difference
between the dynamical masses of FIR-bright and FIR-faint
systems. In what follows, we use these inclination-corrected
estimates of Mdyn.
We ﬁrst note that the dynamical masses of the quasar hosts
cover a very narrow range, ∼ (3.7− 7.5) × 1010 M(cid:12) (i.e.,
spanning roughly a factor of 2), and ﬁve of the six systems
have Mdyn ∼ (6− 7.5)× 1010 M(cid:12) (i.e., spanning less than 0.1
dex). Interestingly, the latter mass is in excellent agreement
with the observed “knee” of the stellar mass function in SF
galaxies (M∗), which is known to show very limited evolu-
tion up to at least z ∼ 3.5 (e.g., Ilbert et al. 2013; Muzzin et al.
2013). We also note that the dynamical masses of the interact-
ing SMGs differ from those of the corresponding quasar hosts
by factors of about 0.85, 0.3, and 1.8 (for the J1511, J0923,
and J1328 systems, respectively). Given the uncertainties on
our Mdyn estimates mentioned above, these mass ratios are
consistent with our interpretation of these interacting systems
being major galaxy mergers (see Section 3.4 below).

To complement our estimates of dynamical masses, we also
derive rough estimates of the dust and gas masses in our
sources. Dust masses are estimated assuming that the FIR
continuum ﬂuxes measured from our ALMA data are emit-
ted by optically thin dust, following an SED with Td = 47K
and β = 1.6, and further assuming an opacity coefﬁcient
of κλ = 0.77 (850 µm/λrest)β (following Dunne et al. 2000,
for consistency with Venemans et al. 2016; see also, e.g.,
Beelen et al. 2006). The dust masses we derive are in the
range Mdust ∼ (0.4− 4.8)× 108 M(cid:12) for the quasar hosts and
(0.2− 0.4)× 108 M(cid:12) for the companion SMGs. Importantly,

the dust masses of the quasar hosts comprise < 1% of the
dynamical masses. This qualitative result is virtually inde-
pendent of the signiﬁcant uncertainties involved in the dust
mass estimates (due to the assumptions on the SEDs and on
κλ ). Rough estimates of gas masses can then be inferred
by assuming a (uniform) gas-to-dust ratio of 100. These are
rather conservative estimates, as several recent studies have
shown that the gas-to-dust ratio in high-redshift hosts may be
signiﬁcantly lower (e.g., as low as ∼ 20 − 60; Ivison et al.
2010; Banerji et al. 2017, and references therein). For most of
the systems, and particularly the quasar hosts, the gas masses
comprise < 20% of Mdyn and reach ∼ 60% in only one quasar
host (J1341). Adopting the aforementioned lower gas-to-dust
ratios would obviously result in yet lower gas-to-dynamical
mass ratios. We conclude that the Mdyn estimates of our
sources are dominated, to a large degree, by the stellar com-
ponents within the galaxies.

Using our estimates of Mdyn as proxies for M∗, we again
ﬁnd that all the FIR-bright systems are found well above the
SF-MS, offset from the relation in Equation 1 by at least 0.5
dex (J0331) and by up to 1.2 dex (J1341). On the other hand,
all the FIR-faint quasar hosts, as well as two of the three ac-
companying SMGs (those of J1511 and J0923), are consistent
with the SF-MS, being within about 0.2 dex of the aforemen-
tioned relation, which is consistent with the intrinsic scatter
associated with it.

3.3.3. SMBH-host galaxy relations

We now turn to compare the mass growth rates and the
masses of the SMBHs powering our quasars relative to those
of the stellar populations in their host galaxies.

For the quasar host galaxies, we assume that the mass
grows only due to the formation of new stars at a rate de-
termined by the CE01-based SFRs (see Section 3.3.1 above).
For the SMBHs, the growth rates are calculated assuming
˙MBH = (1− η)Lbol/ηc2, where Lbol is the bolometric lumi-
nosity, estimated from the rest-frame UV continuum emission
(see T11), and the radiative efﬁciency is assumed to be η =
0.1. We ﬁnd that all systems have ˙MBH/ ˙M∗ > 1/200 (see Ta-
ble 4), with the highest SFR systems J1341 and J1511 having
˙MBH/ ˙M∗ (cid:39) 1/190 and 1/120, respectively. The lower-SFR

The mass and growth-rate ratios we derive can be com-
pared to the typical ratios between the masses of galaxies
and their central SMBHs, as observed in the local universe.
In the MBH regime of our quasars, these are in the range
MBH/M∗ (cid:39) 1/300 − 1/200 (see Figure 9; e.g., Marconi &
Hunt 2003; Haring & Rix 2004; Sani et al. 2011; Kormendy
& Ho 2013). As Figure 9 shows, this is broadly consistent
only with the lower end of the MBH/Mdyn range we ﬁnd in
our quasars. Moreover, for four of the six quasar hosts we
ﬁnd MBH/Mdyn >∼ 1/90, which is signiﬁcantly higher than the
locally observed value. We stress that the BH-to-stellar mass
ratios of our sources would be even higher, thus increasing the
discrepancy with the local value, recalling the alternative MBH
calibration mentioned above and recalling that M∗ < Mdyn
(Section 3.3.2). At the same time, we have shown that Mdyn
itself may be overestimated. Similarly high BH-to-host mass
ratios were derived for other luminous z (cid:38) 5 quasars using
similar data and methods (see, e.g., Walter et al. 2009; Ven-
emans et al. 2012; Willott et al. 2015; Venemans et al. 2016,
and references therein, but also Lyu et al. 2016). This adds
to the evidence for a general trend of increasing MBH/Mhost
with increasing redshift, out to z ∼ 2− 3, that is supported by
several studies with direct estimates of MBH/M∗ (e.g., Decarli
et al. 2010; Merloni et al. 2010; Bennert et al. 2011; Bon-
giorno et al. 2014; Trakhtenbrot et al. 2015, and references
therein), as well as indirect arguments (Netzer 2003; Trakht-
enbrot & Netzer 2010; Caplar et al. 2015). It should be noted,
however, that the high AGN luminosities of our quasars (i.e.,
above the break in the quasar luminosity function) may mean
that the high MBH/Mhost values we ﬁnd do not represent the
general (active) SMBH population at z ∼ 5 (see, e.g., Willott
et al. 2005; Lauer et al. 2007; Caplar et al. 2015).
Turning back to the ˙MBH/ ˙M∗ ratios, the high-SFR systems
in our sample are broadly consistent with what is expected if
one assumes that SMBHs and their hosts grow “in tandem”,
obeying the BH-to-stellar mass ratio observed in high-mass
systems in the local universe at all times. On the other hand,
the high ˙MBH/ ˙M∗ ratios found for the rest of the sample (four
of six quasars) suggests that in these systems the SMBHs
are bound to overgrow the stellar populations. To illustrate
the possible evolutionary scenarios for our SMBHs and host
galaxies, we plot in Figure 9 the expected mass growth in both
the BH and stellar components, assuming the observed (lin-
ear) growth rates are sustained for a short period of 50 Myr
(as in Venemans et al. 2016). Within this short timespan, most
systems will remain broadly consistent with the local range of
MBH/M∗ ratios. If the SMBHs would stop growing within a
comparably short time-scale, at about MBH ∼ 109 M(cid:12), then
their host galaxies would have to experience only a slightly
longer period of SF activity to reach the corresponding lo-
cal mass ratios (MBH/M∗ ∼ 1/300− 1/200). However, if the
BH growth rates are maintained over longer periods, and/or
if the SMBHs are instead assumed to be growing exponen-
tially (i.e., at constant L/LEdd, instead of constant Lbol), then
the SMBHs would signiﬁcantly overgrow their hosts while
approaching the highest BH masses known, MBH ∼ 1010 M(cid:12),
and moving away from the local BH-host relation.
In this
mass regime, the corresponding local mass ratios are on the
order of MBH/M∗ ∼ 1/100, which would still require signiﬁ-
cant SF activity in our objects.
Our conclusions regarding the relative growth rates are in
line with the recent results of Netzer et al. (2016). This study
used Herschel data for a large sample of some of the most

cles). The dotted diagonal lines trace different constant BH-to-host mass ra-
tios. The crosses at the top-left corner illustrate representative measurement
uncertainties (black) on both properties, and systematic uncertainties (gray)
uncertainties on MBH (of 0.4 dex). The signiﬁcant systematic uncertainties
on Mdyn (not shown) are more complicated, involving the poorly-constrained
[C II] emission sizes and inclinations (see Section 3.3.2 for details). Arrows
indicate the possible evolution in both the BH and stellar components, assum-
ing constant mass growth rates over a period of 50 Myr. We note that all BH
masses would increase by 0.24 dex if the calibration of Trakhtenbrot & Net-
zer (2012) is adopted (see text for details). Our quasars cover a wide range,
with most systems being consistent with the ratio observed in the local uni-
verse and some exceeding MBH/Mdyn ∼ 1/100. The extreme object J1341,
which has MBH/Mdyn (cid:39) 1/10 at z (cid:39) 4.8, is expected to evolve towards the
locally observed ratio.

systems have growth-rate ratios as high as ˙MBH/ ˙M∗ (cid:39) 1/30
(median value). These growth-rate ratios are consistent with
those derived in N14 (and in Netzer et al. 2016), which is ex-
pected given the consistency between the new ALMA data
and the previous Herschel measurements.

As for the mass comparison, we rely on the dynamical
mass estimates derived above and the Mg II-based BH masses
available from T11. These MBH estimates used the calibra-
tion by McLure & Dunlop (2004). The more recent cal-
ibration by Trakhtenbrot & Netzer (2012) would have in-
creased MBH by a factor of 1.75 (∼0.24 dex), but we chose
not to use it for the sake of consistency with our own previ-
ous work and with other samples of z >∼ 5 quasars (see also
Shen et al. 2011; Mej´ıa-Restrepo et al. 2016). Table 4 lists
MBH and the BH-to-host mass ratios, which are in the range
MBH/Mdyn ∼ 1/260 − 1/10. Figure 9 shows our estimates
of Mdyn and MBH, along with some similar estimates in lo-
cal galaxies. For this, we use the subset of elliptical galax-
ies tabulated in Kormendy & Ho (2013), for which we take
Mhost = Mbulge.5 We note that Mbulge itself, which is indeed
the focus of many studies of various types of local galaxies
(see an extensive discussion in Kormendy & Ho 2013), is not
accessible with our data.

luminous quasars at z (cid:38) 2 (including all of our sources) and
found that the vast majority of systems has ˙MBH/ ˙M∗ >∼ 1/100,
while a small fraction had ˙MBH/ ˙M∗ ∼ 1/200 − 1/100. As-
suming that the most luminous quasars at z (cid:38) 2 form a con-
tinuously evolving population, the Netzer et al. (2016) study
also suggested that the epoch of fast SMBH growth traced by
our sources would extend to z ∼ 2− 3, perhaps at low duty
cycles (see T11), while the intense SF activity seen in some
of the quasar hosts may decrease shortly after z ∼ 5. In the
context of the z (cid:39) 4.8 quasars we study here, this may indeed
mean that our SMBHs would reach the high end of the known
MBH range, with MBH ∼ 1010 M(cid:12). The (decreasing) SF activ-
ity is still required to sufﬁce to reach MBH/M∗ ∼ 1/100.
We ﬁnally highlight the exceptional properties of the J1341
system, which has a high of MBH = 6.6 × 109 M(cid:12), an ex-
tremely high BH-to-host mass ratio of MBH/M∗ ∼ 1/10 and a
low mass-growth ratio of ˙MBH/ ˙M∗ ∼ 1/190. All this suggests
that the SMBH is approaching its ﬁnal mass, while the host
galaxy is forming stars at an intense rate and the system would
likely expected to approach the high mass end of the z ∼ 0
mass ratio (see Figure 9). This is similar to the over-massive
BH CID-947, recently identiﬁed at z (cid:39) 3.3, and speculated
to have experienced an earlier episode of fast Eddington-
limited growth, to reach the observed MBH (cid:39) 7× 109 M(cid:12) and
MBH/M∗ (cid:39) 1/10 (Trakhtenbrot et al. 2015).6
J1341 may
therefore be illustrative of the scenario of early, fast SMBH
growth to the highest known mass well before z ∼ 4.5, with
somewhat longer timescale stellar growth, to eventually reach
MBH/M∗ ∼ 1/100.

3.4. Major mergers among hosts of fast-growing SMBHs
Given the results of Herschel analysis available prior to the
new ALMA observations, the naive expectation for the sam-
ple under study was that the FIR-bright sources are powered
by major mergers between gas-rich galaxies, while the FIR-
faint sources are evolving secularly or, perhaps, are related to
a later evolutionary phase, where the accreting SMBHs may
have already affected the SF in their hosts (see N14 for a de-
tailed discussion). Moreover, there is strong evidence that the
occurrence rate of mergers among AGN increases with in-
creasing AGN luminosity and redshift (Treister et al. 2012).
Based on these trends, a high occurrence rate of mergers, in
excess of 50% and perhaps as high as 80%, is expected for
our z (cid:39) 4.8, high-LAGN (and high-L/LEdd) quasars. The new
high-resolution ALMA data allow us to critically revisit these
ideas. The small size of our sample naturally limits the scope
of our interpretation, however we note that most of the pre-
vious studies addressing these questions at comparably high
redshifts included yet fewer objects and/or relied on lower-
quality data.
At face value, our new ALMA data clearly show that a sig-
niﬁcant fraction of z (cid:39) 4.8 luminous quasars – 50% in our
small sample – are interacting with companion galaxies of
comparable mass, thus supporting the idea that major merg-
ers are a dominant driver of the intense BH and SF activity.
Moreover, we note that this may constitute a lower limit on
the real fraction of interacting quasar hosts, when considering
the possibility that additional companions are locate just out-
side of the ALMA ﬁelds (i.e., separated by (cid:38) 50 kpc); that

6 It is, however, worth bearing in mind that the two systems (J1341 at
z (cid:39) 4.8 and CID-947 at z (cid:39) 3.3) are drawn from parent samples of markedly
different number densities.

additional close companions are too faint to be detected in
our ALMA data (i.e., have SFR (cid:28) 100M(cid:12) yr−1) and/or that
some of the isolated quasars are actually in the ﬁnal stages of
a merger with interaction signatures that can only be detected
with higher resolution data.

However, the properties of the SMBHs in our sample, their
hosts and companion galaxies under study, highlight sev-
eral shortcomings of the simplistic merger-driven growth sce-
nario. First, two of the three quasars with robust detections
of physically interacting companions (i.e., SMGs) are actu-
ally among the FIR-faint sources, while only one of the FIR-
bright sources has an interacting companion (J1511). Second,
the velocity maps of all the FIR-bright systems, and particu-
larly those that lack companions, show evidence for ordered
rotation, around an axis that coincides with the centroids of
the host galaxies (and quasars’ locations; see Section 3.2 and
Figure 5). The coincidence of the region of zero velocity with
the centroids of the SF activity in the hosts suggests that the
redshifted and blueshifted [C II] emitting regions are not trac-
ing (smaller) coalescing galaxies. Moreover, as noted in Sec-
tion 3.2, the outer parts of the ISM in the FIR-bright systems
appear to be rotation dominated. This is also seen among the
FIR-faint systems, although to a lesser extent.

We also note that the speculation made in N14 that the FIR-
faint systems are found in a later evolutionary stage is disfa-
vored by the new ALMA data, as (two of) the FIR-faint sys-
tems are seen to be in a rather early stage of a major merger.
Their lower SFRs will therefore likely increase as the interact-
ing galaxies coalesce. In principle, a possible interpretation
for our new ALMA data may have been that the SMBH ac-
tivity in the FIR-faint sources is driven by the “ﬁrst passage”
of the interacting quasar hosts with their SMG companions.
Indeed, the high SFRs of the interacting galaxies in the J1511
system may be indicative of what the FIR-faint systems would
undergo in later stages of the interaction. However, most sim-
ulations of major mergers suggest that the SMBH would pro-
duce a luminous quasar, with high L/LEdd, at the ﬁnal coales-
cence phase, and not in the ﬁrst passage phase. These same
simulations also suggest that the ﬁrst passage enhances SFR
in the interacting hosts, to levels comparable to those found
in the later, ﬁnal coalescence phase (see, e.g., Blecha et al.
2011; DeBuhr et al. 2011; Sijacki et al. 2011; Van Wassen-
hove et al. 2012, but also Volonteri et al. 2015 and Gabor
et al. 2015). Our sample, on the other hand, shows simi-
larly intense SMBH growth, with LAGN (cid:39) 1047 ergs−1 and
L/LEdd ∼ 0.5 − 1, for both high- and low-SFR quasar hosts
and among systems with and without an interacting compan-
ion.

Any direct comparison with merger simulations is further
complicated by the possibility that the companion SMGs we
detect at larger separations of ∼ 40kpc may have already ex-
perienced a much closer passage to the quasar hosts and are
observed close to their apocenter. The intense SMBH growth
may have been triggered during this pericenter passage, when
tidal forces were maximal. In this context, we note that any
observations of interacting galaxies would be biased toward
large separations, due to the longer periods spent at increas-
ingly larger separations. Indeed, an inspection of several of
the aforementioned simulations suggests that the interacting
galaxies are separated by (cid:38) 20kpc for over 80% of the simu-
lated merger. First and second passages are extremely short,

18
taking up ∼ 5% of the time.7

Trakhtenbrot et al.

To conclude the discussion of major mergers, we recall that
our SMBHs – as well as the other z (cid:38) 5 quasars mentioned
above – had to grow continuously and at high rates since very
early epochs to account for their high masses (see T11, and
references therein). Given the number of interacting compan-
ions we ﬁnd and their separations from the quasars’ hosts, it
seems unlikely that this kind of mergers can be the only driver
of such a prolonged period of fast growth. All of the above
suggests the epoch of fastest growth of the most massive BHs
is driven, at least in part, by mechanisms that are not related
to major mergers - such as direct accretion of IGM gas (e.g.,
Dekel et al. 2009; Di Matteo et al. 2012; Dubois et al. 2012),
minor mergers, and/or galaxy-scale instabilities of the gas or
stellar components (e.g., Springel et al. 2005; Bournaud et al.
2011, 2012).

Finally, we note that even if the companion SMGs we ﬁnd
are not directly related to the fueling of the fast-growing
z (cid:39) 4.8 SMBHs, their presence seems to support the idea
that rapid early BH growth preferentially takes place in dense
large-scale environments (e.g., Di Matteo et al. 2008; Sijacki
et al. 2009; Costa et al. 2014; Dubois et al. 2012). To date,
such evidence has been highly elusive, with several obser-
vational campaigns looking for over-densities of (rest-frame)
UV-bright galaxies around luminous high-redshift quasars
yielding highly ambiguous results (see, e.g., Overzier et al.
2006; Kim et al. 2009; Utsumi et al. 2010; Husband et al.
2013 for several examples of such over-dense environments,
but also Willott et al. 2005; Ba˜nados et al. 2013; Simpson
et al. 2014 and some of the systems in Kim et al. 2009 for the
contrary). Our analysis demonstrates that such studies may
be signiﬁcantly biased against dust-obscured high-redshift
SF galaxies, thus underestimating the real (over-)density of
galaxies around high-redshift quasars. Indeed, the three in-
teracting companions we identify were not identiﬁed in the
Spitzer images of the respective quasars (N14). A com-
plete census of the cosmic environments of high-redshift, fast-
growing SMBHs would therefore require a multi-wavelength
approach, covering scales of up to a few arc-minutes, and
in spectral regimes that are not affected by dust obscuration.
This can be done, for example, using compact sub-mm arrays.

4. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS

We have presented ALMA band-7 observations of six lu-
minous quasars at z (cid:39) 4.8, drawn from a sample of 40, UV-
selected SDSS quasars with a wealth of supporting multi-
wavelength data. The data probe the rest-frame far-IR contin-
uum emission that arises from cold dust, heated by SF in the
host galaxies of the quasars, as well as the [C II] λ 157.74 µm
emission line that originates from the cold phase of the hosts’
ISM. The ALMA observations resolve the continuum- and
line-emitting regions on scales of ∼ 2 kpc. Our main ﬁnd-
ings are as follows.

1. All quasar hosts are clearly detected and resolved, in
both continuum and [C II] line emission. The con-
tinuum emission suggests intense SF, with the FIR-
bright sources reaching ∼ 1000 − 3000M(cid:12) yr−1, con-
sistent with Herschel observations of these systems.
The quasar hosts exhibit evidence for massive, rotation-
dominated gas structures.

2. Three quasar hosts – one FIR-bright and two FIR-faint
systems – are accompanied by spectroscopically con-
ﬁrmed, interacting companions, with separations in the

We therefore conclude that our ALMA data provide com-
pelling evidence for signiﬁcant galaxy–galaxy interactions
(major mergers) in some, but not all, quasar hosts. Moreover,
the links between these interactions and the intense accretion
onto the SMBHs remains unclear. For the FIR-bright sources,
we caution that even with the new ALMA data, we cannot
completely disprove the possibility that all these systems are
indeed observed in the advanced stages of a major merger. In
particular, the evidence for rotation in the ISM of some quasar
hosts does not by itself disprove a merger scenario, as several
studies of low-redshift mergers (i.e., ULIRGs) have identi-
ﬁed nuclear structures of rotating molecular gas, on scales of
a few kiloparsecs (see, e.g., Downes & Solomon 1998; Tac-
coni et al. 1999; Ueda et al. 2014 and the discussion in Hodge
et al. 2012). Simulations of (low-redshift) major mergers have
demonstrated that such gas disks may indeed form several
hundreds of Myr after the “peak” of the merger, once the co-
alesced nucleus has relaxed (e.g., Barnes 2002; Springel &
Hernquist 2005). On the other hand, the interacting compan-
ions we identify among the FIR-faint systems cannot be re-
lated to the SF and SMBH activity in a straightforward way,
given their large separations. The only way in which all the
quasars in our sample can be explained as triggered by ma-
jor merger is if the FIR-bright systems that lack an interact-
ing companion (namely J0331 and J1341) are observed in the
ﬁnal coalescence stage, while the two interacting FIR-faint
quasar hosts have already experienced a close ﬁrst passage
that triggered the SMBH growth and are observed close to
their apocenter. Even this scenario fails to account for one of
the FIR-faint systems (J0935), which has no companions out
to ∼ 50kpc.

Several sub-mm studies published in recent years have
probed the existence of SF galaxies that are accompanying,
or indeed interacting with, the hosts of z (cid:38) 4.5 quasars. A
prominent example is the interacting system BR1202-0725 at
z = 4.7, which was shown to consist of a pair of interacting
SMGs, separated by 25 kpc, one of which hosting a luminous
quasar, with an additional (marginal) detection of a faint AGN
in the other one (Iono et al. 2006; Wagg et al. 2012; Carniani
et al. 2013). However, such close interactions are found to
be quite rare among high-redshift quasars. Several deep opti-
cal imaging campaigns in the ﬁelds around the known z (cid:39) 6
quasars provide no or little robust evidence for physically as-
sociated companions (e.g., Willott et al. 2005). Moreover,
the sub-mm (ALMA and PdBI) studies published for most of
the known z (cid:38) 6 quasars (by Wang et al. 2013; Willott et al.
2013, 2015; Venemans et al. 2016) – which could have de-
tected companions with SFRs comparable to those we ﬁnd at
separations of up to ∼100 kpc – report no such companions.
Taken at face value, this may suggest a fast increase in the
occurrence of mergers among luminous quasar hosts between
z (cid:39) 6.2 and z (cid:39) 4.8 – that is, within ∼350 Myr. We note, how-
ever, that this discrepancy may be driven by the limited sensi-
tivity and/or limited spatial resolution of the available sub-mm
(ALMA) data for some z (cid:39) 6.2 quasars (e.g., ∼4 kpc in Wang
et al. 2013). Additional deep observations of these z (cid:39) 6.2
sources at sub-kiloparsec resolution may indeed resolve this
discrepancy.

7 It is worth noting that many simulations are set up in a way that will lead
to a merger within a relatively short time, due to computational limitations.
The fraction of time spent at large separations, on the order of ∼ 40kpc, may
therefore be even higher.

range ∼ 14−45 kpc and within |∆v| <∼ 450kms−1. The
companions themselves are forming stars at rates of a
few hundred M(cid:12) yr−1, slightly lower than the quasar
hosts with which they interact.

3. The remaining quasar hosts – two FIR-bright and one
FIR-faint – lack signiﬁcant companions. This, com-
bined with the evidence for rotation, may suggest that
processes other than major mergers are driving the sig-
niﬁcant SF activity and fast SMBH growth in these sys-
tems.

4. The dynamical masses of the quasar hosts, estimated
from the [C II] lines, are within a factor of ∼3 of the
masses of the interacting companions, supporting our
interpretation of these interactions as major mergers.

5. The [C II]-based dynamical masses also show that the
FIR-faint systems are consistent with the “main se-
quence” of star-forming galaxies, while the FIR-bright
systems are located above it.

6. Compared with the BH masses, the [C II]-based dynam-
ical host masses are generally lower than what is ex-
pected from the locally observed BH-to-host mass ra-
tio. In some of the systems, this discrepancy may grow
further, given the high accretion rates of the SMBHs.

7. The L[C II]/LFIR ratios in the quasar hosts are consistent
with those found in other z (cid:38) 5 quasar hosts and SMGs
and follow the observed trend of declining L[C II]/LFIR
with increasing LFIR. Although our data suggest that the
[C II] deﬁcit is most probably driven by mechanisms or
properties that are intrinsic to the quasar hosts, we do
not ﬁnd evidence for the compactness of the SF regions
being the driver of the L[C II]/LFIR − LFIR trend.

Our analysis clearly demonstrates the wide variety of host
galaxy properties, particularly in terms of SFRs and of possi-
ble SMBH fueling mechanisms, among a relatively uniform
population of the fastest-growing SMBHs in the early gas-
rich universe. It appears that vigorous SMBH growth is not
necessarily accompanied by extreme SF activity (i.e., above
what is found in inactive SF galaxies) and that galaxy–galaxy
interactions are not a necessary condition for either of the two
processes. This broadly supports a scenario where intense
SMBH and stellar growth in the early universe is driven by
secular processes, such as large-scale ﬂows of cold gas, that
penetrate into the centers of massive dark matter halos and/or
gas or stellar instabilities on smaller scales.

Our results motivate several paths for follow-up studies to
address and test the predictions of the different fueling mech-
anisms. To robustly determine the role of mergers in the sys-
tems that lack companions quasars would require the detec-
tion of tidal features (e.g., using JWST imaging), or mapping
the ISM kinematics at higher resolution and/or to larger scales
(i.e., with deeper ALMA observations). Obviously, a critical
test of the relevance of mergers to the general population of
high-redshift quasars necessitates a signiﬁcantly larger sam-
ple, with observations that cover a large ﬁeld of view while
maintaining a high spatial resolution. This can be achieved by
extending our analysis to additional z ∼ 5 and z ∼ 6 quasars.
We have recently guaranteed cycle-4 ALMA band-7 time to
observe 12 additional z (cid:39) 4.8 quasars from the T11 sample,
which would allow us to study the host galaxies and close en-
vironments of a total of 18 fast-growing, z (cid:39) 4.8 SMBHs.
